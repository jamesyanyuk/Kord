<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

After having pooled our team's classes inside and outside the major, we have come to realize that many of these classes involve some kind of collaboration and/or communication need, but more importantly an environment that promotes it. Classes that demands to be recognized includes CS320, CS377, Critical Thinking, all English classes, and on a more general note, all classes in the University. Having taken these classes, we were introduced to many methods of communication, including Piazza, Moodle, Git, Google Docs, and Email to name a few. This is a great set of availability for communication and collaboration but they do not provide an excellent substitute for a physical meeting.

In CS320, the focus was on planning over programming, which meant a lot of team interaction needed to place, where ideas, communication, and decisions must be made in real time. A major problem manifested from meet-up availability, because of school scheduling not everyone was able to meet at anytime and anywhere. As a result, meetings were held very late in the day, with emphasis on stress for off-campus students to make the trip to school. CS311 had a similar problem where planning and scheduling posed a big problem that available programs could not completely solve and this overflowed into our ability to code. Google Docs facilitated the process greatly, however it still left some things to be desired.

In other courses like Critical Thinking, and all levels of English courses, collaboration of ideas is crucial to the effectiveness of the class. Students loved to talk about what they wanted to write about, they wanted ways to exchange ideas, get peer-to-peer editing on their work, and a general want to present their paper to someone for some kind of feedback. A problem was the process to do so at the time, was almost non-existent. There was no environment for collaboration unless at the class physically, and only if time is spared specifically for that reason.

Then generally, all classes provide the option for office hours with TAs or the professor, with specific time and a location. This also provided a great way for questions to be answered, however scheduling became a problem once again, and once again no environment to hold effective office hours online. A more pressing problem was office space, TA and professors simply did not have enough space in their office to handle number of students that wanted to attend.

People want an environment that promotes sharing of ideas, interaction with one another, ease of access, and flexibility. Previous courses, if not all, have shown a need for such a platform. A platform that will incorporate the video and text messaging of Skype, the board of Trello, the real-time collaboration of Google docs, and a collaborative "table" all into one easy to use platform. Being able to remove the hassle of micromanaging different programs for different functions will greatly streamline a meeting, announcement, group project, or just a friendly hangout. The team at kord.io will introduce a web application platform that will take the big step in tearing down the dividing line between digital and physical meetings and promote an environment for unhindered collaboration and communication.
