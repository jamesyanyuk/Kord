<h2 id="a1">Project Overview</h2>  

Our project will be composed of two major components. The first and most basic is its chat functionality.
Users will be able to chat through text, audio, or video calls. The revolutionary portion of the project is the 'board'.

Basically, the project is a digital whiteboard. Users can draw on it and other members of the group
will be able to see what was drawn in real time. But more than that, users can drag and drop resources onto it,
such as videos, pdfs, text files, etc. Users can then watch videos, annotate a pdf, edit a text file together, and more.

One major feature would be the dynamic logging system. The platform would save not just a history of the chat, but also
of the board. Users who were unable to attend a meeting, could get caught up by watching the history of the board,
as if someone had recorded a video of it. But even more, users would be able to interact with the pieces of board as it played out.

It offers people an environment to share ideas - to interact in an intuitive and flexible way.

<h2 id="a2">Original Proposal</h2>  

There is currently no platform that facilitates robust, real-time discussion and collaboration.
Solutions such as Google Docs, Trello, and Skype do not allow for both simultaneously.
Thus a combination of productivity, organization, and communication software is required to host a digital meeting comfortably.

Our product streamlines the digital meeting by offering communication, productivity, and organizational tools in one app.
It is a digital work space that a group can see and interact with in real time.
Users can drag and drop resources onto the work space like they would physical resources at a meeting.

More information regarding our original proposal can be found in the /docs/proposal directory. The proposal document contains
member biographies and roles, the problem statement, a product description, a time line, and estimated costs.

##Note for the TA about Trello:  
If you're looking at the Trello board, in the Completed section, you'll find the major milestones
such as, completed Assignment 2, etc. If you go in there, you'll find links
to other cards that you won't see anywhere else on the board.

In an effort to keep things from getting cluttered, we have a board for the current assignment with
cards for each individual task required for the assignment. A member will be assigned and
added to each task/card. Once the assignment has been completed, all of the cards in
the current assignment will be archived. However, a card for the overall milestone (ie. assignment)
will be created and added to the Completed list. Links to each individual card will be added as
comments to the milestone card. That way you can still view who was responsible for what,
but we won't have to clutter the board with a million cards for one single assignment.
